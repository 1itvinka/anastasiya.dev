Recently I needed to create an HTML page to represent a design, without any further integration.

And I faced a dilemma. On the one hand, I wanted to avoid code duplication, use autoprefixer, provide well-structured HTML/CSS, which is split into components, use `for` loops and `if`/`else` statements in my HTML, etc. On the other hand, I didn't want to use any frameworks or complex libraries. I wanted to ship as little extra code as possible. So I went for a very simple static site generator called [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/).

Later on, I created a starting point for my future "design to HTML/SCSS" projects, and I'd like to share it with you.

I hope you'll find it useful!

My website is not a standard blog â€” it's a [digital garden](https://anastasiya.dev/why-digital-garden/), and I constantly add, move around, and remove stuff. So please feel free to join the conversation. All the content is on [github](https://github.com/1itvinka/anastasiya.dev/tree/master/content/blog). Or it might be easier to [discuss it on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=https://anastasiya.dev/eleventy-scss-starter/).
