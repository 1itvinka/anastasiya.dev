#### 1. Subgrid

I'm a big fan of CSS Grid. Unfortunately, right now, when you need to align children elements of to heir parents' grid, you need some manual wizardry. Subgrid is created to solve this problem. I can't wait for this feature to be implemented in all browsers.

#### 2. The ::marker pseudo-element

Finally, we don't need all those hacks for styling lists! Now we can customise the colour, size or type of number or bullet by simply using this pseudo-element. ðŸ™Œ

#### 3. content-visibility

This property enables the user agent to skip an element's rendering until it's needed. It makes the initial page load much faster.

#### 4. Logical Properties

CSS properties and values have traditionally been mapped to the physical properties of a screen. Logical Properties give us the ability to control layout through logical, rather than physical, mappings. It is useful when you need to support different languages, like Arabic or Japanese.

#### 5. Houdini

CSS Houdini is a native way of extending CSS using a set of low-level APIs that expose parts of the CSS rendering engine. Now you don't need to wait for browsers to provide built-in support for the features you need. CSS Houdini enables us to extend CSS as we want. So exciting!
