Wow! I don't even know where to start. This topic is HUGE! Whole books are written on the subject. So my blog posts certainly won't cover everything. But for my future reference I'll try to formalise some of the best practices for producing **readable** JavaScript code that is **easy to change** and **maintain**.

Most of the following principles are not language-specific. But some of them will be relevant only for JavaScript. Many of the guidelines are not universally agreed upon, and some of them are even quite controversial. And of course it's important to remember that blindly applying even the best practices can do more harm than good.

I don't like long files so I'll split the topic into a number of small posts. I plan to explore the following themes:

[Part 0: Comments](https://anastasiya.dev/comments/)  
[Part 1: Names](https://anastasiya.dev/names/)  
Part 2: Variables  
Part 3: Functions  
Part 4: Classes  
Part 5: Objects and Data Structures  
Part 6: Concurrency  
Part 7: SOLID  
Part 8: DRY  
Part 9: Inheritance Tax  
Part 10: Error Handling  
Part 11: Testing  
Part 12: Formatting  
Part 13: Tools  
Part 14: Philosophy and Quotes

As my website is not a standard blog, but rather a [digital garden](https://anastasiya.dev/why-digital-garden/), I'll be constantly adding, moving around and removing stuff. So please feel free to join the conversation. All the content is on [github](https://github.com/1itvinka/anastasiya.dev/tree/master/content/blog). Or it might be easier to [discuss it on Twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/search?q=https://anastasiya.dev/clean-js-code/).
