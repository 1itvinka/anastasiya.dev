### [Maybe You Should Talk to Someone](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Maybe-You-Should-Talk-Someone-ebook/dp/B07KM93FN7/)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41lmhgvgBjL._SL500_.jpg)

I absolutely loved the book. It made me cry and laugh, and think a lot about my life. My favourite book this year so far.

If you'd like to spend less money on marketing and recruiting â€” write a book like this! ðŸ˜‰ It was so good to learn more about Twilio, its history, values, and priorities. The CEO of Twilio truly understands what makes good developers tick. Part 3 if full of great ideas. Highly recommended!

### [No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention](https://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860)

A great book about the company culture at Netflix: the culture of ownership, responsibility and continuous improvement. Although the rules described here won't work for every company/team, I would highly recommend the book to executives and managers in tech.

### [Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512279/)

I'm still shocked at what disadvantage can people start their lives. People in education should definitely adjust their approaches if they work with kids like David.

I totally agree with the importance of owning your life and getting rid of the "victim's mentality" no matter what. It doesn't matter if you're a minority or was at a disadvantage, or things are not fair â€” you're responsible for your life and your future.

But I disagree that intentionally go through all that suffering and injuries is a healthy way to approach life.

My website is not a standard blog â€” it's a [digital garden](https://anastasiya.dev/why-digital-garden/), and I constantly add and move around stuff. I'll be adding the books I've read in 2021 as the year progresses.
