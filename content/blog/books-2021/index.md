### [Ask Your Developer](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ask-Your-Developer-Software-Developers-ebook/dp/B08425FV7S/)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61cTxHI9qiL._SL500_.jpg)

If you'd like to spend less money on marketing and recruiting â€” write a book like this! ðŸ˜‰ It was so good to learn more about Twilio, its history, values, and priorities. The CEO of Twilio truly understands what makes good developers tick. Part 3 if full of great ideas. Highly recommended!

### [No Rules Rules: Netflix and the Culture of Reinvention](https://www.amazon.co.uk/No-Rules-Netflix-Culture-Reinvention/dp/1984877860)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bvrB6WjPL._SL500_.jpg)

A great book about the company culture at Netflix: the culture of ownership, responsibility and continuous improvement. Although the rules described here won't work for every company/team, I would highly recommend the book to executives and managers in tech.

### [Drive: The Surprising Truth about What Motivates Us](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Drive-Surprising-Truth-About-Motivates-ebook/dp/B0033TI4BW/)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bCDvxyngL._SL500_.jpg)

Do rewards motivate people? Yes! They motivate people to get rewards.

This book answers the questions: why bonuses in most cases don't work, why you should never pay your child for doing chores, why people work on open source projects, etc.

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SIyrqOdxL._SL500_.jpg)

Although the title feels "cheap", it's a very good book, full of useful information and ideas that I've never though about. Engaging and easy to follow. Will definitely read it again.

### [Why We Eat (Too Much)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Eat-Too-Much-ebook/dp/B07XLFX52N/)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qaGvaR-aL._SL500_.jpg)

Another great book. The key idea is that any strict diet will only slow down the metabolism and increase your body's weight set point, which will eventually result in more weight gain. It has nothing to do with self-control and willpower. The subconscious mind always wins this buttle. Only by targeting the weight set point and the signals that communicate with it, it's possible to lose weight for good. I highly recommend this book not only to people who want to control their weight, but also to anyone who've ever judged overweight people.

This book is an excellent guide on the skincare routines, products, how to use them, and what to avoid. This information is such a game changer for me! Highly recommended.

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/416aXMcBWBL._SL500_.jpg)

Entertaining and hillarious dive into complicated and often taboo topics. Couldn't put it down.

### [Nobody Told Me: Poetry and Parenthood](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nobody-Told-Me-Poetry-Parenthood-ebook/dp/B010PFFQ62/)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519FQSCkzPL._SL500_.jpg)

It was so good to re-live those precious moments of pregnancy, birth, and first yeas of been a mum. That's funny how similar and at the same time how different we are. I had many similar thoughts and frustrations, but many of them seem to me like overthinking.

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41P2X-Sjo6L._SL500_.jpg)

A light read. Autobiography + life advice on parenting, independence, health, beauty, modelling, and ageing. Ok, but I don't think I'll read it again.

### [Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512279/)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ln2UdUzhL._SL500_.jpg)

I'm still shocked at what disadvantage can people start their lives. People in education should definitely adjust their approaches if they work with kids like David.

I totally agree with the importance of owning your life and getting rid of the "victim's mentality" no matter what. It doesn't matter if you're a minority or was at a disadvantage, or things are not fair â€” you're responsible for your life and your future.

But I disagree that intentionally go through all that suffering and injuries is a healthy way to approach life.
