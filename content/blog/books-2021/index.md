If you'd like to spend less money on marketing and recruiting â€” write a book like this! ðŸ˜‰ It was so good to learn more about Twilio, its history, values, and priorities. The CEO of Twilio truly understands what makes good developers tick. Part 3 if full of great ideas. Highly recommended!

A great book about the company culture at Netflix: the culture of ownership, responsibility and continuous improvement. Although the rules described here won't work for every company/team, I would highly recommend the book to executives and managers in tech.

### [Why We Eat (Too Much)](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Why-We-Eat-Too-Much-ebook/dp/B07XLFX52N/)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41qaGvaR-aL._SL500_.jpg)

Another great book. The key idea is that any strict diet will only slow down the metabolism and increase your body's weight set point, resulting in more weight gain. It has nothing to do with self-control and willpower. The subconscious mind always wins this buttle. Only by targeting the weight set point and the signals that communicate with it, it's possible to lose weight for good.

### [Nobody Told Me: Poetry and Parenthood](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Nobody-Told-Me-Poetry-Parenthood-ebook/dp/B010PFFQ62/)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519FQSCkzPL._SL500_.jpg)

It was so good to re-live those precious moments of pregnancy, birth, and first years of being a mum. That's funny how similar and at the same time how different we are. I had many similar thoughts and frustrations, but many of them seem to me like overthinking.

### [Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Cant-Hurt-Me-Master-Your/dp/1544512279/)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Ln2UdUzhL._SL500_.jpg)

I'm still shocked at what disadvantage can people start their lives. People in education should definitely adjust their approaches if they work with kids like David.

I totally agree with the importance of owning your life and getting rid of the "victim's mentality" no matter what. It doesn't matter if you're a minority or was at a disadvantage, or things are not fair â€” you're responsible for your life and your future.

But I disagree that intentionally go through all that suffering and injuries is a healthy way to approach life.
