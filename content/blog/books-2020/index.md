## Books for Everyone

<section class="book">

#### [The Power of Habit: Why We Do What We Do, and How to Change](https://amzn.to/2F6h31J)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PAtnlvW1L._SL500_.jpg)

This book shows how habits drive the behaviour of individuals, organisations, and societies. I can't recommend the book enough! I'll definitely reread it in the future.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [How to Fail at Almost Everything and Still Win Big: Kind of the Story of My Life](https://amzn.to/33H98SS)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cA0gImCZL._SL500_.jpg)

The book is full of great ideas like:

- goals are for losers, and systems are for winners;
- a combination of skills at which you are "good enough" can make you really valuable.

And many more. I'm definitely going to reread soon!

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Never Split the Difference: Negotiating as if Your Life Depended on It](https://amzn.to/3a6CYkG)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51TSWCruAHL._SL500_.jpg)

This book is the first in my list "to reread with full concentration while taking notes". The techniques seem to be really useful, although I haven't tried all of them yet.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die](https://amzn.to/3acbXfF)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51fhNaNM87L._SL500_.jpg)

My presentations and talks will never be the same again! The book is full of tips about effective and persuasive communication. Must read for anyone involved in education.

My top picks:

- be aware of "the curse of knowledge";
- the most memorable messages are in the form of a story.

Although the book could be much shorter, I've enjoyed it from start to finish.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Permission to Screw Up. How I Learned to Lead by Doing (Almost) Everything Wrong](https://amzn.to/3hCRkvX)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41yGM8LleOL._SL500_.jpg)

Loved it! It's a book that every leader should read. Full of stories, direct and honest. Highly recommended!

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Influence. The Psychology of Persuasion](https://amzn.to/2KJebLu)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51K-iHvDHNL._SL500_.jpg)

Although many tricks are obvious for me, I learned a lot from this book. That's very useful to know how you can be manipulated by marketers, politicians, salespeople, waiters, etc. And the knowledge of some patterns of human behaviour can even save lives (see chapter "Social Proof").

The "Authority" part surprised me the most, to be honest. I was shocked by the results of the experiment described there. This power might explain some of the horrible things that were going on in Belarus in august 2020.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [The Chimp Paradox](https://amzn.to/33H8gh0)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51BydRgJ2CL._SL500_.jpg)

The mind model described in the book is absolutely brilliant. It says that within our mind, we have three powers: the human, the chimp, and the computer. The author explains how to manage them so that both your chimp and your human are happy, and the computer helps you, not vice versa. Many good points, but the book could be much shorter.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Peak Performance: Elevate Your Game, Avoid Burnout, and Thrive with the New Science of Success](https://amzn.to/30FlSHG)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ssxrhLwCL._SL500_.jpg)

Although the book was super dull at the beginning, I'm glad I kept listening as the second half was definitely worth it!

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Make Time: How to focus on what matters every day](https://amzn.to/33Slc3N)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51gQ7pHF-zL._SL500_.jpg)

The book is full of great tips and practical advice about helping you make time for what is actually important to you — highly recommended to anyone glued to his smartphone. 😉

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Algorithms to Live By: The Computer Science of Human Decisions](https://amzn.to/2PCRDKU)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/519lKuoLN-L.jpg)

Any mathematician or/and a programmer will absolutely love this book! Very well written, and the concepts are useful in everyday life. Added to my "must reread" list.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Tools of Titans: The Tactics, Routines, and Habits of Billionaires, Icons, and World-Class Performers](https://amzn.to/2C8eHy2)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51xVXCYXeGL._SL500_.jpg)

Although the audio version is quite hard to follow, this book is packed with great tips and ideas. Many of the tips in the "Health" section sound too extreme for me, but I've found lots of useful ideas in the "Wealth" and "Wise" sections. The top tip for me was about hanging upside down. I'm not sure if it helps to sleep better, as it's stated in the book, but it saves my back after hours of lifting, holding, and carrying my baby.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [How to Own the World: A Plain English Guide to Thinking Globally and Investing Wisely](https://amzn.to/31wtwDj)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PFdz2QfFL._SL500_.jpg)

I wish I'd read this book in my early 20s. It's an invaluable guide for a complete novice like me. The book is focused on the UK, which is a huge bonus, as I've moved to this beautiful country not long ago. For example, I didn't know about ISAs before I read this book. 😭 Must read again!

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [The Simple Path to Wealth: Your road map to financial independence and a rich, free life](https://amzn.to/2DzmuFN)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/414UzZxaSFL._SL500_.jpg)

Although the book is very US-focused, most principles are universal. I'll definitely reread it if I ever move to the USA.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Bad Blood: Secrets and Lies in a Silicon Valley Startup](https://amzn.to/2PEtzY0)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41O5blDy52L._SL500_.jpg)

I'm still shocked that this happened in real life. How did it all get so far? A perfect illustration of how quickly a culture of lie, fear, and cult can spread and rise into power. But it never lasts forever.

This book makes you question the healthcare systems and the regulatory institutions even more. Now I will definitely make sure to double-check any suspicious blood test results.

The book made me think about my professional life as well:

- about how vital is the culture of transparency and good communication;
- that working mess isn't better than nothing;
- how important it is to defend code quality;
- that a prototype is not the finished product even if it looks like it. We should never agree to ship it!

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Small Change: Money Mishaps and How to Avoid Them](https://amzn.to/3rJKHNU)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51bm0GW2pqL._SL500_.jpg)

A good rehash of “Predictably Irrational" by the same author, but nothing new.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [The Lean Startup](https://amzn.to/3519XWj)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PAIR77wJL._SL500_.jpg)

I first read this book years ago. That's my favourite book about startups, entrepreneurship and validated learning. Highly recommended!

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Spark Joy: An Illustrated Guide to the Japanese Art of Tidying](https://amzn.to/30GfAHH)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/31oTRCUjznL._SL500_.jpg)

I absolutely love the concept. The most insightful parts for me were about organising a kitchen and about folding stuff.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Running Like a Girl](https://amzn.to/3fzux2w)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51-gQGdYHCL._SL500_.jpg)

Gobbled up the book in 2 days. I always thought running is not my thing, even though I love to be active, and I love games like tennis, where you need to run a lot. But after reading this book, I was inspired to give it another try.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [How to Win Friends and Influence People](https://amzn.to/3afolvC)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51PWIy1rHUL._SL500_.jpg)

Must read for everyone. I'll try to reread this book every year.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Ultralearning: Accelerate Your Career, Master Hard Skills and Outsmart the Competition](https://amzn.to/2Py53Il)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/511nxjb8PCL._SL500_.jpg)

Full of great stories and very well-written, but I've already forgotten most of the principles. 🙄 Must read again then! And what is more important, that would be fun to test it on actual "ultralearning projects".

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [24 Assets: Create a digital, scalable, valuable and fun business that will thrive in a fast changing world](https://amzn.to/31sDwxo)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51cxEs66USL._SL500_.jpg)

It's an excellent book for entrepreneurs or business owners. I'll definitely reread it if I start my own company or a passive income project.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Hit Refresh: A Memoir by Microsoft’s CEO](https://amzn.to/3imKV8l)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41ikuB0l8qL._SL500_.jpg)

Good read overall, but as for me, there's too much advertising for Microsoft.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [The Latte Factor](https://amzn.to/2X2zD0s)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Q+x7munYL._SL500_.jpg)

Nothing new for me here. But it was a good reminder about the power of the compound effect.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Becoming](https://amzn.to/34ZUlT2)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41Y1DPGbDvL._SL500_.jpg)

I really enjoyed the story, and I learned more than I thought I would. I learned not only about Michelle's life, her family, her dreams and worries, but also about the USA, politics, society, etc.

## Books for Parents:

Although physically exhausting, my 1st year of being a mum was pretty straightforward: just keep that baby happy, full, and clean. But as my son suddenly became an active toddler, I've realised that I had no idea how to react to tantrums, how strict I should be, and how to maximise my chances of raising a happy, confident, independent, and kind individual. So I've done what all geeks do when they face an area of incompetence - I've stuffed my face with books on this topic. 🤪 Here're the best I've read so far:

<section class="book">

#### [How To Talk So Little Kids Will Listen: A Survival Guide to Life with Children Ages 2-7](https://amzn.to/2DQwhHh)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/6137ZXV2sxL._SL500_.jpg)

Such a useful guide that's full of brilliant tips! I'll definitely reread it next year.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [The Gentle Sleep Book: Gentle, No-Tears, Sleep Solutions for Parents of Newborns to Five-Year-Olds](https://amzn.to/2DLWzux)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51SpxSOx1TL._SL500_.jpg)

I wish I'd read this book almost two years earlier! At least I would be much calmer and felt less guilty that I've followed my instincts and not all the well-meaning advice about teaching your baby to sleep "properly". I've just started to implement the principles from this book - we'll see if it helps. But even if not, it's a relief to hear that it's absolutely normal for a small child to wake up so often, and to demand my presence during his naps and at night.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [The Book You Wish Your Parents Had Read (and Your Children Will Be Glad That You Did)](https://amzn.to/3kqh14V)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/412BjWQUQwL._SL500_.jpg)

I can't recommend it enough. It was the first parenting book I've read. And it absolutely changed my view on this topic.

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [Calm Parents, Happy Kids: The Secrets of Stress-free Parenting](https://amzn.to/3inr6Ok)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/41NCU460OAL._SL500_.jpg)

Although the book is very repetitive, which is a bit annoying, the tips are incredibly useful!

</section>

<section class="book">

#### [The Danish Way of Parenting](https://amzn.to/3hDGKFe)

![Book Cover](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51z+Grj8LsL._SL500_.jpg)

I didn't find anything new here, but that's probably only because I've already read so many books on parenting. It's a great book and easy to read, though!

</section>

### Books for Parents in Russian:

It's a shame I haven't found the following books in English translation. If you're a parent and you know Russian, all of the following books are highly recommended. And the first 2 are absolutely must-read!
