When I first heard about "digital gardens" on a [Syntax](https://syntax.fm/show/249/hasty-treat-scott-s-new-personal-website/?target=_blank) podcast I was absolutely in love with the idea! A digital garden is not a traditional blog with a number of static posts. But rather it's a spot where ideas, resources, and just random bits of information are evolving in real time.

Here's why I like the concept so much:

- It's how we write software today. It's an agile way of creating stuff using lots of iterations.
- My ideas and beliefs are not static, they evolve over time. As well as my English. lol
- It can be a space to experiment and to see where it goes.
- It can be a space to structure my knowledge and ideas.
- Writing a polished technical article from scratch sounds overwhelming, taking notes that can evolve into something useful - is fun!
- It's a place for collecting the dots. And I love bullet point lists. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
