#### 1. "What is Your Current Salary?"

If you hear this question, you'll probably be underpaid. Or if you're smart enough not to be tricked by this question, you'll probably work with people who undercut themselves by answering it. As for me, that's the biggest red flag that I don't want to work in such company. It's an entirely irrelevant question, and it should be treated as such.

If you're in a "squeeze situation" and you don't have a choice, never tell your current salary anyway. Say you are not comfortable sharing this information. Or say that it's the confidential information of your current employer. Or you can simply tell them that you prefer not to say because it will put you in disadvantage of negotiating the salary at this company.

I highly recommend the book "Predictably Irrational" by Dan Ariely to learn about the anchoring effect.
