Yay! It's here! My first personal website!

## The Story Behind Picking The Stack

When I first decided to create my website I’ve told myself:

"Hey, don’t even think about developing it from scratch! It’s not a priority so you won’t find time to do it! Just go for an existing blogging platform and set it up in an hour!"

And... I’ve done exactly the opposite. 🤦‍♀️

Here’s why:

- That would be nice to use markdown and to have all the content under version control.
- I wanted to have a custom domain.
- I definitely didn't want to deal with Wordpress.
- I have no idea right now where this project goes and what it will eventually become, so I'd like to have the freedom to easily change it, so I could play and experiment.

So after some investigation it became clear that I need to go for a static site generator like 11ty, Next.js or Gatsby.

I've decided to pick [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) because of it's plugin ecosystem and the community. Also the ability to handle images is a huge selling point of Gatsby!

All the styling is done with [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/). I absolutely love the styling solution and the MUI components really speed up design and development.

I'm hosting the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Their auto-deployment solution rocks! Thanks guys for creating such a fantastic tool!

Overall I'm pretty happy with the result. And even if I abandon blogging after a while I've learnt A LOT during the development process.

All the code to the website is on [github](https://github.com/1itvinka/anastasiya.dev). That's my first attempt to use Gatsby, and that's my first published React project. So I would really appreciate your code reviews, fixes or comments. I also really hope that the codebase will be useful for someone else.
