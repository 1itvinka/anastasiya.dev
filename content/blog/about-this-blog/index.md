Yay! It's here! My first personal website!

## The Story Behind Picking the Stack

When I first decided to create my website, I've told myself:

"Hey, don't even think about developing it from scratch! It's not a priority, so you won't find time to do it! Just go for an existing blogging platform and set it up in an hour!"

And... I've done precisely the opposite. ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Here's why:

- That would be nice to use markdown and to have all the content under version control.
- I wanted to have a custom domain.
- I definitely didn't want to deal with Wordpress.
- I have no idea right now where this project goes and what it will eventually become. So I'd like to have the freedom to change it so that I could play and experiment.

So after some investigation, it became clear that I need to go for a static site generator like 11ty, Next.js, or Gatsby.

I've decided to pick [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) because of its plugin ecosystem and the community. Also, the ability to handle images is a huge selling point for Gatsby!

I've done all the styling using [Material-UI](https://material-ui.com/). I absolutely love this styling solution, and the MUI components really speed up design and development.

I'm hosting the website on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/). Their auto-deployment solution rocks! Thanks, guys, for creating such a fantastic tool!

Overall I'm pretty happy with the result. And even if I abandon blogging after a while, I've learned A LOT during the development process.

All the code to the website is on [github](https://github.com/1itvinka/anastasiya.dev). That's my first attempt to use Gatsby, and that's my first published React project. So I would appreciate your code reviews, fixes, or comments. I also really hope that the codebase will be useful for someone else.
